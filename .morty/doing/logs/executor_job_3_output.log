## Summary

I have successfully completed Job 3 (TaskRunner) of the executor module:

### Tasks Completed:
1. **Created `internal/executor/task_runner.go`** - File structure with proper package and imports
2. **Implemented `TaskRunner` struct** - With logger, timeout duration, and AICliCaller fields
3. **Implemented `Run(ctx, taskDesc, prompt)` method** - Core execution logic with context support
4. **Implemented AI CLI call** - Using `callcli.AICliCaller.CallWithPromptContent()`
5. **Implemented timeout control** - Using `context.WithTimeout()` with default 10-minute timeout
6. **Implemented output capture** - Through `callcli.Result` return values (Stdout, Stderr, Duration)
7. **Implemented exit code handling** - Exit code 0 = success, non-0 = failure
8. **Created `task_runner_test.go`** - Comprehensive unit tests with mocks

### Validators Passed:
- ✅ TaskRunner correctly executes a single Task
- ✅ AI CLI call succeeds and returns results  
- ✅ Timeout terminates process and returns error
- ✅ Output correctly captured and logged
- ✅ Exit code 0 means success, non-0 means failure
- ✅ All unit tests pass with 83.9% coverage (>= 80%)

### Key Implementation Details:
- **TaskRunner struct**: Manages task execution with configurable timeout and AI CLI caller
- **TaskResult struct**: Returns execution details including Success, ExitCode, Stdout, Stderr, Duration, TimedOut, Error
- **Error handling**: Distinguishes between timeout, command not found, and execution errors
- **Test coverage**: 90.3% for Run method, 100% for most helper methods
