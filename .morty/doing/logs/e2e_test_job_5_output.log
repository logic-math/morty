## Summary

All tasks for e2e_test/job_5 have been completed successfully. Here's what was accomplished:

### Tasks Executed:
1. **Task 1: Execute first Job** - Ran `morty doing` successfully
2. **Task 2: Verify state checks** - Confirmed status.json is loaded and first PENDING job is found
3. **Task 3: Verify AI CLI calls** - The executor properly initiates job execution
4. **Task 4: Verify Job execution** - Jobs executed and completed successfully
5. **Task 5: Verify status updates** - status.json properly updated with COMPLETED status
6. **Task 6: Verify Git commits** - Git commits created with format `morty: loop N - sudoku/job_N - COMPLETED`
7. **Task 7: Execute multiple jobs** - All 3 jobs (job_1, job_2, job_3) executed consecutively

### Key Changes Made:
1. Updated `cmd/morty/main.go` with full command routing for research, plan, doing, stat, reset commands
2. Created `pathsConfigManager` adapter to implement `config.Manager` interface
3. Fixed test project status.json to use correct format (global/modules/version)

### Validator Results:
- [x] `.morty/status.json` exists and state is correct
- [x] Git commit history contains morty loop commits (3 commits)
- [x] Each Job completion has corresponding Git commit
- [x] Logs record complete execution process
- [x] Exit code is 0 for successful executions
