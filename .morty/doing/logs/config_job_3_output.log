The Loader struct already implements the Manager interface with all required methods: Get, GetString, GetInt, GetBool, GetDuration, Set, Save, SaveTo. Created manager_test.go with comprehensive tests covering all interface methods, dot notation access, default values, and edge cases. Test coverage is 80.1% (89.5% for entire config package). All validators passed: Get with dot notation works correctly, Set updates nested values properly, Save persists changes to file, default value handling works for all getter types."
