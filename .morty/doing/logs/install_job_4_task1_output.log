Task 1 is complete. Here's the summary:

## Summary

Successfully implemented `bootstrap_cmd_upgrade()` and all supporting functions for Job 4 Task 1:

### Implemented Functions

1. **`bootstrap_get_current_version()`** - Reads the installed version from the VERSION file
2. **`bootstrap_get_latest_version()`** - Fetches the latest version from GitHub API (with fallback)
3. **`bootstrap_compare_versions()`** - Compares semantic version strings (returns 0=equal, 1=v1>v2, 2=v1<v2)
4. **`bootstrap_backup_installation()`** - Creates a full backup of the current installation
5. **`bootstrap_migrate_config()`** - Handles configuration migration between versions (placeholder for future)
6. **`bootstrap_rollback_upgrade()`** - Rolls back to the previous version on upgrade failure
7. **`bootstrap_cmd_upgrade()`** - Main upgrade command handler

### Features
- Compares current vs target version and prompts if already up-to-date
- Warns and prompts when attempting to downgrade
- Creates full installation backup before proceeding
- Downloads and installs new version atomically
- Verifies installation after upgrade
- Automatically rolls back to backup on any failure
- Preserves user configuration during upgrade

### Tests Passed
All version comparison tests pass (equality, greater than, less than, v-prefix normalization)
