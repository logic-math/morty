All 32 tests pass. Now let me output the final RALPH_STATUS.

## Summary

I have successfully completed all 7 tasks for **doing_cmd/job_2: Job execution** (State Management Integration):

### Tasks Completed:
1. **Task 1: `loadStatus()`** - Implemented function to load state from `.morty/status.json` file
2. **Task 2: `--restart` logic** - Implemented state reset for all jobs, module jobs, or specific job
3. **Task 3: `selectTargetJob()`** - Implemented target job selection based on module/job parameters
4. **Task 4: Prerequisite checking** - Implemented prerequisite validation using plan file parsing
5. **Task 5: `updateStatus()`** - Implemented state update functionality
6. **Task 6: State persistence** - State changes are persisted to file via state manager
7. **Task 7: Unit tests** - Added 20+ new tests covering all new functionality

### Key Changes:
- **doing.go**: Added state management methods (`loadStatus`, `handleRestart`, `selectTargetJob`, `checkPrerequisites`, `updateStatus`, `calculateModuleStatus`, `getStatusFilePath`)
- **doing_test.go**: Added comprehensive test coverage including helpers (`setupTestState`, `setupTestPlanFile`)

### Verification:
All 32 tests pass, including:
- 7 original tests (updated to work with new state management)
- 20+ new tests for state management functionality
