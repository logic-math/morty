All tasks completed successfully. Here's the execution summary:

## Summary

**Completed Tasks:**
1. ✅ Created `internal/parser/interface.go` - Defined `Parser` interface, `FileType` constants, `ParseResult` struct, and extension mappings
2. ✅ Created `internal/parser/factory.go` - Implemented parser factory with registration, retrieval, and file type detection
3. ✅ Implemented `DetectFileType()` - Detects file type based on extension (supports .md, .json, .yaml, .yml, etc.)
4. ✅ Implemented `Register()` - Thread-safe parser registration with duplicate detection
5. ✅ Implemented `Get()` and `GetByExtension()` - Parser retrieval methods
6. ✅ Implemented error handling - Custom errors for unknown file types, parser not found, etc.
7. ✅ Created `factory_test.go` - Comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage

**Validator Results:**
- ✅ File type detection by extension works correctly
- ✅ Parser registration and retrieval work correctly
- ✅ Unknown file types return appropriate errors
- ✅ All unit tests pass with 100% coverage
- ✅ Race detector passed (no concurrency issues)

**Files Created:**
- `internal/parser/interface.go` (51 lines)
- `internal/parser/factory.go` (139 lines)
- `internal/parser/factory_test.go` (428 lines)
