All tasks for state/job_3 have been completed successfully. Here's the summary:

## Execution Summary

### Completed Tasks (9/9):
1. ✅ Created `internal/state/transitions.go` file structure
2. ✅ Defined valid state transition rules table (`TransitionRules`)
3. ✅ Implemented `IsValidTransition(from, to Status) bool`
4. ✅ Implemented PENDING → RUNNING → COMPLETED main workflow
5. ✅ Implemented FAILED → PENDING retry flow
6. ✅ Implemented BLOCKED → PENDING unblock flow
7. ✅ Implemented RUNNING → BLOCKED block flow
8. ✅ Invalid transitions return error and log to logger
9. ✅ Created comprehensive unit tests `transitions_test.go`

### Validators All Passed:
- ✅ PENDING → RUNNING is valid
- ✅ RUNNING → COMPLETED is valid
- ✅ RUNNING → FAILED is valid
- ✅ FAILED → PENDING is valid (retry)
- ✅ PENDING → COMPLETED is invalid
- ✅ Invalid transitions return false and error with `TransitionError`
- ✅ All unit tests pass (coverage: **92.2%** ≥ 80%)

### Key Implementation Details:
- `TransitionRules` map defines all valid state transitions
- `IsValidTransition()` validates transitions between any two statuses
- `Manager.TransitionJobStatus()` performs validated transitions with logging
- `CanTransition()` checks if a transition is allowed without performing it
- `GetValidTransitions()` returns all allowed next states for a given status
