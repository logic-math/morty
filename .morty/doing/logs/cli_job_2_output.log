I have completed cli/job_2. Here's the summary:

## Implementation Summary

### Files Created
1. **`internal/cli/router.go`** - Router implementation with:
   - `CommandHandler` type for handler functions
   - `Option` struct for command options
   - `Command` struct for command definitions
   - `Router` struct with thread-safe command map
   - `NewRouter()` - Creates new router instance
   - `Register(cmd Command) error` - Registers commands with duplicate detection
   - `Execute(ctx, args) error` - Routes and executes commands
   - `GetHandler(name) (CommandHandler, bool)` - Case-insensitive handler lookup
   - `ListCommands() []Command` - Returns all registered commands
   - Friendly error messages in Chinese for unknown commands

2. **`internal/cli/router_test.go`** - Comprehensive unit tests (500+ lines) covering:
   - Router initialization
   - Command registration (valid, duplicate, empty name, nil handler)
   - Case-insensitive registration and lookup
   - Handler retrieval
   - Command listing
   - Command execution with options and arguments
   - Unknown command error handling
   - Context propagation
   - Concurrent access safety
   - Benchmarks

### Validators Passed
- [x] Register command and get handler by name
- [x] Route to registered command executes handler correctly
- [x] Route to unregistered command returns error "未知命令: xxx"
- [x] `ListCommands()` returns all registered commands
- [x] Command names are case insensitive
- [x] Code compiles successfully
